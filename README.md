# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple and tiny Rock Paper Scissors game

I'm learning JavaScript and I decided to make this little game for practice.
You will play it with a machine.
On the left side, you can choose your weapon and see what happens.
It would mean a lot to me if you tell me your opinion and commit changes so I can learn from you tooðŸ˜„.
Hope you enjoy!
